\title{
Assigns SNPs to pathways
}
\description{
Assigns SNPs to pathways, using the pathway gene members and the SNPs assigned to each gene
}

\usage{
snps.to.pathways(pathway,gene.snps)
}

\arguments{
  \item{pathway}{A list of pathways with their gene members
 }
  \item{gene.snps}{A list of genes with the SNPs assigned to them according to their physical distance on the genome
}
}

\value{
A list of the same size as the number of pathways in the pathway list. The names of the SNPs assigned to each pathway are returned
}
